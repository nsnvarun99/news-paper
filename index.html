        <p id="about MSD">  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mahendra Singh Dhoni (born 7 July 1981) is an Indian professional cricketer. He is a right handed batter and a wicket-keeper. Widely regarded as one of the most prolific wicket-keeper-batsmen and captains, he represented the Indian cricket team and was the captain of the side in limited-overs formats from 2007 to 2017 and in test cricket from 2008 to 2014. Dhoni has captained the most international matches and is the most successful Indian captain. He has led India to victory in the 2011 Cricket World Cup, the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 and the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, the only captain to win three different limited overs tournaments. He also led the teams that won the Asia Cup in 2010, 2016 and was a member of the title winning squad in 2018.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Born in Ranchi, Dhoni made his first class debut for Bihar in 1999. He made his debut for the Indian cricket team on 23 December 2004 in an ODI against Bangladesh and played his first test a year later against Sri Lanka. In 2007, he became the captain of the ODI side before taking over in all formats by 2008. Dhoni retired from test cricket in 2014, but continued playing in limited overs cricket till 2019. He has scored 17,266 runs in international cricket including 10,000 plus runs at an average of more than 50 in ODIs.</p>
         <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dhoni plays for Chennai Super Kings in the IPL, leading them to the final on ten occasions and winning it five times (2010, 2011, 2018, 2021 and 2023). He has also led CSK to two Champions League T20 titles in 2010 and 2014. He is amongst the few batsmen to have scored more than five thousand runs in the IPL, as well as being the first wicket-keeper to do so.

            In 2008, Dhoni was awarded India's highest sport honor Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna Award by Government of India. He received the fourth highest civilian award Padma Shri in 2009 and third highest civilian award Padma Bhushan in 2018.

                    Dhoni became a regular in the Indian side after the home series against South Africa in November 2005.[45] In December 2005, Dhoni was awarded a "B" grade contract by the BCCI.[46] Dhoni made his test debut in the same month against Sri Lanka during their tour of India at Chennai.[47][48] Dhoni scored 30 runs in his debut match, that was marred by rain and ended in a draw.[49] Dhoni made his maiden half-century in the second test leading to an Indian win.[50] Dhoni played all the matches in the subsequent tour of Pakistan scoring 219 runs in five ODI matches and 179 runs in five tests including his maiden test century in the second test in Faisalabad.[51] He scored 106 runs across three tests in the home series against England in March 2006 and 177 runs in five ODI series that followed.[51][45] Dhoni dropped multiple catches and missed dismissal chances including a key stumping opportunity of Andrew Flintoff which led to criticism of his wicket-keeping.[52]
                    
                    In the DLF Cup 2006-07, Dhoni scored 43 runs as the team lost twice in three games and did not qualify for the finals. In the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy, India lost to West Indies and Australia, though Dhoni scored a half-century against West Indies and failed to make it to the knock out stage.[53] In the ODI series in South Africa in November 2006, Dhoni scored 139 runs in four matches in the series loss.[45] In the test series that followed, Dhoni scored 114 runs in two tests including a first test victory in South Africa in the first test, but was ruled out of the third test with injury.[54] Dhoni made his T20 international debut in December 2006 against South Africa at Johannesburg.[55] Dhoni was subsequently named in the ODI team of the year by the ICC for 2006.[56]</p>

                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dhoni is a right-handed batsman and wicket-keeper.[116] Dhoni is an unorthodox batsman who deviates from conventional coaching manuals to showcase his batting technique.[162] Dhoni displays a proclivity for hitting full-length deliveries towards the Long-on, Long-off, and Midwicket regions, rather than the conventional Cover region.[162] He plays pull shots and hook shots off short-pitched deliveries often putting pressure on the bowler to adjust their line and length accordingly. Dhoni holds the bat with a firm grip at the bottom of the handle, striking the ball with force and precision to clear the boundary.[163] He is a powerful hitter of the ball and is one of the fastest men in running between the wickets.[164] He plays the helicopter shot technique, taught to him by a fellow player and childhood friend Santosh Lal.[165][166][167] As a batsman, he is recognized for his finishing skills in high-pressure situations.[168]

                    He has also been praised for his lightning-fast glove-work behind the stumps while also being criticized for the lack of good technique.[169][170] He is known for his unorthodox captaincy, approachability and has earned a reputation of being a successful leader.[171][172] Dhoni is also known for his cool-headed demeanor on the field which has earned him the monicker "Captain cool".[173]</p>

                <p>Dhoni led the Indian squad for the 2011 Cricket World Cup co-hosted by India.[74] India won its second ever ODI world cup after defeating Sri Lanka in the final with Dhoni being named man of the match for scoring an unbeaten 91.[75] In December 2012, Pakistan toured India for a bilateral series for the first time in five years and Dhoni top-scored in all the three matches of the series with a century in the first ODI at Chennai.[76] Dhoni led India to victory in the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy and became the first and the only captain in international cricket to claim all ICC limited overs trophies. In the rain-shortened final against England, India won by five runs on DLS method though Dhoni himself was out for a duck.[77] He was also named as captain and wicket-keeper of the 'Team of the Tournament' by the ICC.[78]


                    Dhoni batting against South Africa during the group stage match of 2013 ICC Champions Trophy
                    After the Champions Trophy, India toured West Indies for a tri-nation tournament against the hosts and Sri Lanka.[79] Dhoni got injured at the start of the tournament thus ruling him out for most of the tournament and returned to play the final where he was adjudged Man of the match for scoring 45 runs off 52 balls including 16 runs in the final cricket to take India to victory by one wicket.[80] In November 2013, Dhoni became the second India batsman after Sachin Tendulkar to aggregate more than thousand runs in ODIs against Australia.[81] India toured South Africa and New Zealand in the 2013–14 season. Though Dhoni scored 84 runs at an average of 48 including one half-century against South Africa and 272 runs with three consecutive 50-plus scores against New Zealand, India lost both the series.[45] Dhoni himself reached 8000 runs in ODI in the series against New Zealand.[82] Dhoni led India in the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 where India finished as runners-up after losing to Sri Lanka in the final.[83] He was named as captain and wicket-keeper of the 'Team of the Tournament' by the ICC.[84]
                    
                    India won the away ODI series in England in 2014 and series against West Indies in India where Dhoni scored 146 runs across the five innings he batted.[85][45]</p>
